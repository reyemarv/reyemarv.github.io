Man oh man, and here I thought that taking everything I learned and applying it to this project would be easier. Yeah, not so much. Truthfully, this took longer than I had expected, but I have to say that loved this experience. When you get to the point that your able to make your program work just how you wanted to, its a great feeling. All I can really say is, patience. You need to have patience. 

Obviously for some it will be easier to grasp and move a quicker pace, while for other no so much. However, the end goal is all that matters. In my case the setting up of the project really wasn't too bad. Fortunatley our coach was able to give us some good pointers and a great guide to getting started. Truth be told, if it weren't for that, who knows how much longer this would have taken. Nope, for me the challenge was figuring out what I wanted to do and how to do it. 

My first couple of choices were great ideas to me, however the sites I chose for his project were a little outside my level of experience. I tried to go bigger and failed, but hey, its all good. I was able to get so far, but it all helps to continue learning. Eventually I came to settle for what would be my project. What it was is a gem that would allow for us to scrape a site which lists the current top 25 instagram accounts ranked by followers. This gem would allow it to take data from the site and create a list. From that list it would allow the user to choose one and then allow the program to return details of that account. Its name, handle, rank, and followers. 

I knew what I wanted, so now the challenge was getting the right pieces in place for it to grab the correct data. Man, this is where I still had some challenges as of course our code doesn't always do what we intended for it to do. For example, I had times when my code would shoot me my list twice, undefined errors of items I had defined, and of course the when inspecting the site finding that some of the items I would need are in the same named class. There were times I just had to switch out and do somethign else. Go out for a hike, socialize with some friends, binge on rewatching Dexter on Netflix, etc. Anything to give me a break so that I could come back and think clearly and maybe find what I was missing. And honeslty, it did help. 

I'll admit that my main problem was that I kept trying to solve the puzzle in one try. That is, I was trying to get it all completed at once, rather than taking it step by step and building its blocks. I knew what I wanted my code to do, but I needed to ask myself, what is the purpose of each piece? Once I got into that mindset, everything else began to work out. Solve each problem and error in that block, after that move on to the next, and so forth until you have all that you need. Then its just about putting it all together. I was finally able to make it work and not only that, but create its error messages and making sure the program continued to loop until the user decided to exit out. Not only that, but I feel that I've left it at a point where it not only works, but is able to continue to be built on and improved on. 

Yep, this project was def a great experience and I will continue to work on this later on as I have some ideas I'd like to add to it. From here its just continue to practice and get better. My biggest advice is again, patience. There will be errors, fails, and so on, but thats the fun part. Finding the solution and once it works its all worth it. Other than that I would say, just use all the sources available if you feel stuck. There is so much out there. Beleive me, there a couple things that I found by just using google and the sources available here. Anyways, that all I got for today, and if your about to start your first CLI, well good luck!
