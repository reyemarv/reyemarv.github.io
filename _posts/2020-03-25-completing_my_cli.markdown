So this would be my second chort, but in all honesty, probably the best decision. It gave me time to review things over again and have a better understanding of what I was learning. This also gave me the oppotunity to look at my CLI porject and understand what I was doing. 

I decided to keep my CLI project and take my time going through its code and understanding what my code was doing. My project was based on scraping a site. Some may not like this and prefer to use an API, but for some reason, I find scraping to be fun. I was able to find a few tricks that helped me on the way. Thank you Google and Slackoverflow! So what was I scraping you ask. Well, I decided to go with top 25 instagram accounts. My cli would allow the user to get a display of the top 25 accounts on instagram via a random site. From here the user would have the choice to go even further. With an input, the user could choose if they wanted more details over that account then just their name and rank. This would allow them to get the info on their rank, name, handle, and the amount of followers they have. 

Each part of the cli, would ask them for a choice, but if provided with an invalid input, it would simply throw them a message to choose from what was available or exit. It would then loop back around givng the user the ability to input again. The cool, part was that I was able to get it to loop around once more asking the user if they would like to see another account, rather than just end. 

One of the items that I struggled with at the beginning was finding a way to get the exact piece of data I needed to display. In the table on the site, it would be hard in certain sections as when I was trying to scrape certain data, I was given a return of more than what I wanted. Instead of trying to add more and more code to cut down on what I had, I googled on how I can try to get once piece of data in one line. That's when I came accros the nth child. I gotta say, that this is probably my most favorite part of this project. Just seeing how somethign so random, can make my life so much easier. 

What I like about this simple program as well is that not only is it fun to see it work, but also that it has the ability to continue to be added onto. On my own time, I will contineu to play around and just see how much more I can do, but for now its taking the time to understand the purpose of each part of code. Looking foward to my review once more and hopefully this time, with a better understanding.
