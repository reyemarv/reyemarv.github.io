So the question is something like, what is somethig interesting I learned or did while learning logic and conditinos? I am a little further than this now, but looking back I would say that what was interesting is the way these conditions can be set up. Starting where I did to now, I can tell you that I've seen many solutions to one problem. None are wrong, it just depends on how that person was thinking about the problem, or even what they used. 

There are many times that I've thought to myself, what the hell am I doing or how did others even find a solutions? The thing that I've found is that 9/10 times someone else has had the same question or a similar problem. Its looking at your sources like classmates, recorded videos, or simply google. As I've continued to move forward in this bootcamp I've started to pick up a few things. You begin to find methods that you had no idea existed and could cut your work in half. A lot of it really is using logic though. I feel like sometimes I do get stuck trying to fix one issue and seeing just an error message, rathe than thiking of it logically. What do I want my code to do? Asking the right questions and turning them into steps to get the right result, rather than trying to resolve it all in one try.

If you're like me and have been stuck at times, trust me, it does get better with practice. There are many solutions to one problem and with time you'll find better ways.
