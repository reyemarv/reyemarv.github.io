Well, first blog post ever... What's up guys and welcome. So as I mentioned in my about section, this blog is really more of a testing ground for me and about this journey I've taken to becoming a SD. I've never done any kind of blog before, so bear with me. What I wanted to write about today is answering the question, "Why I chose to study software Engineering?

The reality is, I've always had an interest in tech overall, but never really took the time to see what I was most interested in. Growing up and seeing the eveolution of tech was always cool, but that's as far as it went. Just seeing what was trending at the time and whether I got my hands on it or not. Everythign else, I guess you could say is your "typical road to success". What I mean by that, is that sometimes you do get sucked into a certain career path that you think will help you be successfull and happy. You chase the title or higher salary, but not for the right reasons.

I would see many of my friends doing what they love to do, while others not so much. The ones that were truly happy with their careers were those who didn't care about the bigger check. Nope, they followed their passion and did what they did, because they truly wanted it. I recenlty lost my job a few months ago and it sucked. I had very good position. One that was lucrative and helped me accomplish a lot, but with it came stresses and moments that made me question why I was doing it at all. This was someone else's passion, but not mine. I think the fear of starting over, taking a pay cut, or giving up what I've worked for always held me back. For a couple of years now I kept wanting to make a change, but just never did. Next thing, life happens and you're forced to make changes. 

At first, I didn't know what to do. I got another job doing somethig similar, but this time becasue I "had" to, and that didn't feel good. I came to realize that even though what had happend sucked, it was my opportunity to make a change. To not get stuck again. Talking to a friend in Denver, he introduced me to his work as a SD. He explained the details andwhat is world is It got me, I was hooked. He started sending me things to read and free courses to try.  Well, one thing led to another and here we are. I finally found what what I was looking for. Something that challenges me in a good way and that involves my true interests. Seriously? Why the hell didn't I do this sooner? 

I chose software enginerring, because it involves the things that I love. Tech, solving puzzles, creating, and more. I'm truly excited to see where this new road takes me. I'm excited to learn something new. Just don't tell my boss that soon enough I'll be submitting my 2 weeks. Just kidding...not really. Anyways, I though I would share and interested to see the reasons that others have chosen to take this path as well and where they came from. But until next for now!
