So have I have found commonalities between coding and my life? Yes, yes I have. Being in this program for about 2 months now and I have to say, it sure doesn't get easier. However, I continue to enjoy it and although there are many, and I mean SOOOO MANY TIMES that i have no idea what the hell I'm doing or even how i solved something, I feel that we can relate in our lives. What I've discovered so far is that coding his about patience, taking things step by step rather than trying to figure everything out at once. When we're stuck we try to find answers and sometimes we just have to take a step back, relax, and then come back with a cool head to find the solution. Much of coding is thinking logically, what are we trying to do and how can we make it do what we need it to do? Finally one of the biggest things is learning to accept that your way or someone else's way, isn't the only way. So yeah, I would say yes, I've found many commonalities between coding and aspects of my life recenlty. Well, my break is over, back to work!
