<p>Hey there, I'm Marvin Reyes, a New York born, Indiana raised, and Austin living guy. Continuing to explore and learn from the lessons of life. I have 2 year German Shepherd named Zoe, who's my partner in crime and who I believe enjoys the same things I do, maybe... i'm not sure, our conversations tend to be one sided. Some of my hobbies include photography, hiking, bouldering, and your monthly traditions of Cars & Coffee. A few other things, but we'll get there with time. Really, I tend to be open minded, always wanting to learn something new, looking for the next adventure, and trying new things. Anyways, this blog is pretty much a pilot for me. A way for me to document my journey in what is now the coding world. I'm now studying to become a Software Engineer, so join me on this path and lets see where it takes us together!</p>
